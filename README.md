## Why

Three things, mostly:

🔁 **Seamlessly switch devices.** Start a Claude Code session on your laptop, get a push on your iPhone when it needs you, attach from the phone, answer, detach. The session keeps going. Pick it up on your laptop in the morning, exactly where you left it.

🎛️ **One dashboard for every Claude session.** Live view of every running session across every project — *active*, *idle*, **waiting for your input** — color-coded, one key to attach. No more remembering tmux session names.

☕ **Your laptop won't sleep while Claude is working.** A small background daemon holds a `caffeinate` lock while sessions are active and releases it when they go quiet. Close the lid; Claude keeps thinking.

Built on `tmux` (durability), `Mosh` + `Tailscale` (mobile-friendly connectivity), and [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (the workload). ccmux is the TUI that ties them together.

> **TUI-first, CLI when you want it.** Everything in this README — new projects, attaching sessions, switching hosts, editing config, running the tour — works inside the TUI with discoverable keys and a `?` help overlay. No commands to memorize. The CLI subcommands (`ccmux new`, `ccmux list`, `ccmux update`, …) are there for scripts, muscle memory, and pipelines, but they're optional.
>
> **No `ccmux host add` needed.** ccmux scans your Tailscale network on every refresh, probes each peer for a `ccmuxd /v1/health`, and adds the responders to your dashboard automatically. Install ccmux on a new device, start its daemon (`ccmux daemon install`, `listen_tailnet = true`), and it shows up on every other device on the tailnet within seconds. The `ccmux host add` command still exists for hosts outside Tailscale or for pinning a specific port — pure convenience.

## 60-second start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skzv/ccmux.git
cd ccmux && make setup
```

`make setup` builds, installs to `~/.local/bin/`, and runs an interactive wizard that checks `tmux` / `mosh` / `tailscale` / `claude` / `gh` and offers `brew install` for whatever's missing. Idempotent — re-run any time.

Then:

```bash
ccmux                # launch the TUI (first-run tour included)
ccmux ~/code         # one-shot: scope this session to ~/code instead of ~/Projects
ccmux new my-app     # scaffold a project + start its Claude session
ccmux list           # what's running, everywhere
ccmux update         # pull latest, rebuild, reload daemon
```

## What it looks like

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ccmux                          local ✓     mini ✓     5h: 47% │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  NAME              STATE          PATH                          │
│  c-auth-redesign   ● needs_input  ~/Projects/auth-redesign     │
│  c-checkout-bug    ● active       ~/Projects/checkout-bug      │
│  c-ml-experiments  ○ idle         mini:~/Projects/ml-exp       │
│  c-blog            ○ idle         ~/Projects/my-plain-blog     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`1`-`6` jump between screens, `Enter` attaches, `?` opens contextual help, `T` re-runs the first-run tour.

## 📱 Mobile

```bash
ccmux moshi-setup
```

Installs [moshi-hook](https://getmoshi.app/) on the Mac, walks you through pairing with the Moshi iOS app, and wires the Claude Code hooks that turn `needs_input` events into **categorized** push notifications on your phone (approval_required vs task_complete). Tap, you're already on the right session, attach with one key, answer, detach with `prefix L` to land back in the TUI.

Plain BEL fallback works in any iOS terminal client (Blink Shell, Termius) — you lose the categories, that's it.

## 🛰️ Remote (always-on Mac Mini, auto-discovered)

```bash
# On the Mini:
ccmux daemon install                       # ccmuxd survives reboot
# edit ~/.config/ccmux/config.toml: listen_tailnet = true

# On the laptop — nothing to do:
ccmux                                      # dashboard already lists the Mini
```

Every refresh, ccmux runs `tailscale status --json`, probes each online peer for a `ccmuxd /v1/health`, and merges the responders into the host list. New device on the tailnet running ccmux? It just appears. The Devices panel on the Dashboard shows each peer's reported ccmuxd version with an "update available" tag whenever it lags this build.

Attaching a remote session execs `mosh mini -- tmux attach -t <name>`. Mosh tolerates roaming and stalls, so you can close the lid, go to a coffee shop, open the laptop — your session resumes instantly. Your phone gets pushes from the Mini, same flow as Mobile above.

> Manually pinning a host with `ccmux host add` still works — useful for non-Tailscale hosts, or to force a specific port. Discovered hosts and pinned hosts coexist on the dashboard without duplicates.

## Features

### Session management
- Live dashboard of every Claude session across every project, with state (active / idle / **needs_input**)
- One-key attach, kill, rename, snapshot — applies a styled tmux status bar so you always know where you are
- Per-session "keep awake" pin
- **Three sleep-prevention modes** — Safe (AC only, default), Dangerous (battery too, opt-in with low-battery auto-release), Very Dangerous (system-wide lid-close override, sudo-gated)
- Live preview pane: tail any session without attaching

### Project bootstrapping
- `ccmux new <name>` — scaffolds a project, creates the `docs/` notes vault, runs `git init`, opens a Claude session with your description as the first prompt
- `ccmux upgrade` — retrofits the same structure into an existing directory
- Local-only by default — push to GitHub when you're ready with `gh repo create`

### Claude Code config management
- Dedicated "Claude" screen for everything in `~/.claude/`
- Model picker (Opus 4.7 / Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5 / opusplan / custom) — global or per-project
- Browse + create slash-command aliases, manage MCP servers, hooks, permission allowlists
- View & edit global and per-project `CLAUDE.md` from the TUI

### Notes, terminal-native
- Per-project Notes tab — tree view of `docs/` with inline markdown rendered by [Glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour)
- Quick-actions: new Agent Log (today's, auto-templated), new Spec, new ADR
- Ripgrep-backed search; plain markdown on disk is the source of truth (no required cloud)

### Mobile workflow (Moshi / iOS / Android)
- **Categorized push notifications** via `moshi-hook` plugging into Claude Code's hooks system
- **One-command setup** with `ccmux moshi-setup`
- **Auto-detection** — ccmuxd suppresses its own BEL trigger when moshi-hook is paired so you don't get duplicate notifications
- **Persistent outer tmux session** — Moshi's `tmux new-session -A -s ccmux ccmux` puts you back in the TUI every time you open the app

### Local & remote modes
- **Local** — manages tmux sessions on this machine; prevents sleep while sessions are active
- **Server** — daemon binds an HTTP API to your Tailscale interface so other devices can list/attach
- **Mixed** — dashboard shows local + remote sessions, color-coded by origin

### Setup, doctor, update
- `ccmux setup` — interactive wizard, checks every dep, offers `brew install` for missing pieces
- `ccmux doctor` — non-interactive health check (great for scripting)
- `ccmux update` — pulls the git checkout, rebuilds, reloads ccmuxd
- `ccmux uninstall` — clean removal, never touches your projects or `~/.claude/`

### Quality of life
- Catppuccin Mocha by default; Dracula / Nord / Gruvbox / Tokyo Night planned
- `?` opens contextual key help on every screen
- Vim-style (`h/j/k/l`) and arrow keys both work
- Auto-switches to a narrow-terminal layout under 80 cols (phone mode)
- Mouse support on by default
- **No telemetry. Ever.**

## Tutorials

Six hands-on walkthroughs. Each is self-contained — pick whichever maps to what you're trying to do.

### 1. Your first project, end-to-end (≈3 min)

The core loop: scaffold → talk to Claude → take notes → commit.

```bash
ccmux new auth-redesign -d "rebuild the login flow with passkeys"
```

That single command:
1. Creates `~/Projects/auth-redesign/` with `docs/01_Specs/`, `docs/02_Architecture/`, `docs/03_Agent_Logs/` — just the documentation vault. The source-code layout (cmd+internal? src? a Python package dir?) is chosen by Claude during `/init` based on the language you pick.
2. Writes a starter `README.md` + `.gitignore`, runs `git init`, makes the first commit.
3. Opens a tmux session named `c-auth-redesign`, starts Claude inside it.
4. After Claude boots, types your description as the first prompt — Claude reads it, asks 2-3 clarifying questions, and writes `docs/01_Specs/00_Initial_Concept.md` from your answers.

Everything stays local. When you're ready to push to GitHub:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/auth-redesign
gh repo create --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

To check on the session without joining the conversation: `ccmux list`. To attach: `ccmux attach auth-redesign`.

The session keeps running after you detach. Your laptop's lid can close (on AC power) and it'll still be there tomorrow.

### 2. Juggling multiple Claude sessions (≈2 min)

You have three projects moving in parallel. Open the TUI:

```bash
ccmux
```

The Dashboard shows all sessions, color-coded by state:

- **active** — Claude is generating output right now.
- **idle** — Claude finished, no prompt visible.
- **needs_input** — Claude is showing its input box and the pane has been quiet for ≥ 3 seconds. **This is the one to watch.**

When any session transitions to `needs_input`, ccmuxd injects a terminal BEL. Any iOS terminal client that does BEL→notification raises a push.

Useful keys on the Sessions screen:
- `Enter` — attach
- `x` — kill the highlighted session
- `R` — rename
- `k` — pin keep-awake (the daemon holds a `caffeinate -s` while pinned)
- `?` — full keymap

### 3. Working from your phone (≈5 min, one-time setup)

Goal: your iPhone gets push notifications when Claude needs you, you tap, you're attached.

```bash
ccmux moshi-setup
```

The wizard installs `moshi-hook`, walks through Moshi's pairing flow, and writes the Claude Code hook entries.

On your phone:
1. Install [Moshi](https://getmoshi.app/) from the App Store.
2. Tap "Add Host", paste the pairing token.
3. Moshi opens a persistent tmux session named `ccmux` and drops you into the TUI.

Now whenever Claude pauses for input on the Mac, your phone vibrates. Tap, the TUI's already on the right session, attach with Enter, answer, detach with `prefix L` (returns you to the outer ccmux session, not the iOS app).

For a non-Moshi setup, the BEL still produces a generic notification — categories disappear, everything else works.

### 4. Customize the scaffold (≈2 min)

`~/.config/ccmux/config.toml` — the knobs that matter:

```toml
[projects]
root = "~/Projects"                  # where ccmux looks for projects

[scaffold]
# Default below — just the docs vault, because the source-code shape is
# language-specific and /init handles it better. Want to enforce src/+tests/?
# Set them here.
dirs = ["docs/01_Specs", "docs/02_Architecture", "docs/03_Agent_Logs"]

# What `ccmux new` sends to Claude as the first message. {{name}} and
# {{description}} are substituted. Empty falls back to the built-in default.
initial_prompt = """
We're starting "{{name}}". {{description}}
…
"""

create_initial_commit = true         # auto-commit on scaffold

[daemon]
poll_interval_seconds = 2
idle_seconds_for_needs_input = 3
listen_tailnet = false               # set true on your server-mode host
tailnet_port = 7474
```

`projects.root`, `scaffold.dirs`, and `subscription.tier` are also editable inline from the Settings screen — `↑/↓` to move, `Enter` to edit, `e` to open `$EDITOR` for the prose-heavy fields.

After editing, run `ccmux update` to reload the daemon with the new config.

### 5. Multi-machine: laptop + always-on Mac Mini (≈5 min)

The intended workflow for heavy users. Sessions live on the Mini; your laptop and phone are clients. **No manual host configuration** — ccmux auto-discovers every ccmuxd on your tailnet.

**On the Mini:**

```toml
# ~/.config/ccmux/config.toml
[daemon]
listen_tailnet = true
tailnet_port   = 7474
```

```bash
ccmux daemon install   # registers ccmuxd under launchd so it survives reboot
```

**On the laptop:**

```bash
ccmux                  # the Mini already appears on the dashboard, tagged "discovered"
```

The Devices panel shows each peer's ccmuxd version. If the Mini is behind your laptop's build, it gets an "update available" tag — run `ccmux update` on the Mini (or SSH in and do it) to bring them in sync.

Attach to a remote session and ccmux execs `mosh mini -- tmux attach -t <name>`.

### 6. Maintenance (≈1 min)

```bash
ccmux doctor          # one-shot health check
ccmux update          # git pull + rebuild + reinstall + restart daemon
ccmux uninstall       # clean removal
```

`ccmux update` auto-detects your git checkout (defaults to `~/Projects/ccmux`). Flags: `--dry-run`, `--skip-pull`, `--no-restart`.

## Install

**From source (Homebrew tap coming with v0.1 release):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skzv/ccmux.git
cd ccmux
make setup
```

`make setup` builds, installs `ccmux` + `ccmuxd` into `~/.local/bin/`, then runs the wizard. Idempotent — re-run any time.

Requirements:
- Go 1.22+ (build only)
- macOS or Linux
- `~/.local/bin` on your PATH

```bash
ccmux          # launch the TUI
ccmux setup    # re-run the wizard
ccmux doctor   # health check
```

## Uninstall

```bash
ccmux uninstall            # interactive: shows what it'll do, asks y/N
ccmux uninstall --yes      # skip the prompt
ccmux uninstall --dry-run  # preview only
```

What gets removed:
- Running `ccmuxd` (SIGTERM)
- `~/.local/bin/ccmux` and `~/.local/bin/ccmuxd`
- `~/.local/state/ccmux/` (socket, logs)
- `~/.local/share/ccmux/` (snapshots, daemon db)
- `~/.config/ccmux/` (unless `--keep-config`)
- The ccmux-styled tmux status bar on every `c-*` session (unless `--keep-chrome`)

What is **never** touched:
- Your project directories
- Notes under `<project>/docs/`
- `~/.claude/` (Claude Code state + moshi-hook entries)

To also remove `moshi-hook`: `brew services stop moshi-hook && brew uninstall moshi-hook && brew untap rjyo/moshi`.

## Roadmap

Phasing in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Headline:

- **v0.1** — TUI, sessions, notes, setup wizard, daemon, local + server + mixed modes, terminal-bell notifications, Homebrew tap
- **v0.2** — Snapshots, themes, command palette, tailnet web viewer for notes, cost tracking from Claude transcripts
- **v0.3** — Multi-select session ops, activity heatmap, daily-journal rollups, mDNS host discovery
- **Long term** — Native SwiftUI iOS app talking directly to ccmuxd over Tailscale

## Design principles

1. **Terminal-first, not terminal-only.** Must work in a Mosh pane on an iPhone.
2. **One source of truth: tmux.** ccmux is a view; tmux is the database.
3. **Plain markdown on disk** beats vendor lock-in. No required cloud, no required sync.
4. **Notifications by terminal bell.** Reuses what every iOS terminal client already supports.
5. **Setup is a flow, not a README.** First-run wizard installs what it can, instructs for what it can't.
6. **No telemetry. Ever.**

## Status

**Alpha.** Core flows (attach, new, kill, notes, daemon, Moshi) work end-to-end. Expect rough edges; file issues. Wait for v0.1 if you want it for real work.
